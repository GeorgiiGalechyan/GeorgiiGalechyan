## 👋 Hi, my name is Georgii and I am a beginner javascript developer.

I am a lawyer from Russia with over 10 years of practice😎. I work as a freelance lawyer 😈, and in my spare time I do programming 😇.  
I like the fact that in programming only I have an influence on the final result. Minimum of extraneous human factor 😌!  
I really enjoy it, when lines of code turn into something tangible, whether it's data handling or application interfaces 😏.

### What I'm doing now

I'm studying ***Fastify***❤️ and ***Postgres*** right now .
> It's strange that although everyone praises Fastify for its productivity, they mostly use Nest with express.js under the hood 😫.  

I also develop projects for my portfolio. So far I use React on the frontend, and Fastify on the backend.   
My future plans are to write an application using Nest on the backend and Next on the frontend.  
I want to make programming my main job! 

### Looking for my first job! 😉
